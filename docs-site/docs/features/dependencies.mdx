# Dependencies

Concord flows use <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="step">task</span> provided by external Java libraries (plugins). These are declared as Maven dependencies
in your `concord.yaml`. The plugin understands these declarations and uses them to power features like
[task name completion](#task-name-completion) and the [Dependencies view](./tool-window#dependencies) in the tool window.

## How it Works

When a project is opened, the plugin:

1. **Collects** all dependency declarations from `configuration.dependencies`, `configuration.extraDependencies`,
   and the same sections inside <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="section">profiles</span>.
2. **Resolves** each dependency to a local JAR file using your Maven local repository (`~/.m2/repository`).
   If a JAR is not found locally and the IntelliJ Maven plugin is available, it will attempt to download it.
3. **Extracts** task names by scanning `@Named` annotations inside the JARs
   (via the `META-INF/sisu/javax.inject.Named` index).
4. **Provides** the extracted names as completion suggestions for <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="step">task:</span> values, scoped to the correct project.

### Supported Dependency Locations

The plugin looks for dependency lists in the following YAML paths:

```concord
configuration:
  dependencies:
    - "mvn://com.walmartlabs.concord.plugins.basic:smtp-tasks:2.8.0"
  extraDependencies:
    - "mvn://com.walmartlabs.concord.plugins:git:2.12.0"

profiles:
  production:
    configuration:
      dependencies:
        - "mvn://com.walmartlabs.concord.plugins:s3:1.5.0"
```

## Task Name Completion

Once dependencies are resolved, the plugin provides autocompletion for the <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="step">task:</span> field in flow steps:

    <img src={require('@site/static/img/task-name-autocompletion.png').default} alt="Concord Task" />
    <figcaption>
        Context-aware autocompletion for task names extracted from Maven dependencies.

</figure>

Task name suggestions are **scope-aware**: each [scope](./scopes) only shows tasks from its own dependencies.

:::tip
Press <Keystroke mac={[{icon: "⌃", label: "Ctrl"}, {label: "Space"}]} win={[{label: "Ctrl"}, {label: "Space"}]} /> in a `task:` value to see all available task names for the current scope.

## Error Reporting

When a dependency cannot be resolved — for example, due to incorrect coordinates or an unavailable artifact — the plugin
reports the problem in three places simultaneously.

### Inline Editor Errors

Each unresolvable `mvn://` string is highlighted directly in the editor as an inspection error.
The error message includes the reason for the failure (e.g. "artifact not found").

Invalid dependency format (not matching the `mvn://group:artifact:version` pattern) is also flagged.

    <img src={require('@site/static/img/unresolved-dependency-editor.png').default} alt="Unresolved dependency highlighted in editor" />
    <figcaption>

</figure>

:::tip
You can configure the severity of this inspection (Error, Warning, etc.) in
**Settings | Editor | Inspections | Concord | Unresolved dependency**.
:::

### Build Sync Tab

Dependency resolution progress and errors are reported in the **Build** tool window under the **Sync** tab.
Clicking an error navigates to the exact line in the YAML file where the dependency is declared.

    <img src={require('@site/static/img/unresolved-dependency-sync.png').default} alt="Dependency errors in Build Sync tab" />
    <figcaption>

Additionally, files that contain unresolved dependencies are marked as problem files in the **Project** tree
(file names displayed in red), making it easy to spot affected files at a glance.

## Server-Only Versions

Some dependencies use special version string like `latest` that are resolved
at runtime by the Concord server. While these work fine when a flow is executed on the server,
the IDE cannot resolve them locally — which means **task name completion**, **parameter validation**,
and **hover documentation** won't work for those tasks.

The plugin detects these versions and shows a **weak warning** on the dependency string:

<figure className="docFigure docFigure--lg">
    <img src={require('@site/static/img/deps-inspection-warn.png').default} alt="Server-only dependency version warning" />
    <figcaption>

### The `cli` Profile Approach

The recommended solution is to add a concrete version of the dependency to a special
<span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="section">profiles</span> → `cli` section. The plugin resolves
dependencies from all profiles, including `cli`, so this gives the IDE what it needs without
affecting server execution:

```concord
configuration:
  dependencies:
    - "mvn://com.walmartlabs.concord.plugins.basic:smtp-tasks:latest"

profiles:
  cli:
    configuration:
      dependencies:
        - "mvn://com.walmartlabs.concord.plugins.basic:smtp-tasks:2.36.0"
```

The original `latest` version is preserved for the server, while the IDE uses the concrete `2.36.0`
to provide full autocomplete and validation.

### Quick Fix: Add to `cli` Profile

The plugin provides a quick fix that automates this process:

1. Place the caret on the highlighted dependency.
2. Press <Keystroke mac={[{icon: "⌥", label: "Alt"}, {label: "⏎"}]} win={[{label: "Alt"}, {label: "Enter"}]} /> to open the intention menu.
3. Select **Add to cli profile with concrete version**.
4. Enter the desired version in the dialog that appears.

The plugin will create the `profiles.cli.configuration.dependencies` structure automatically
if it doesn't exist, or append to the existing list.

    <img src={require('@site/static/img/deps-quick-fix.png').default} alt="Quick fix to add dependency to cli profile" />

    <figcaption>
        After applying the fix, the concrete version is added to <code>profiles.cli</code> and the warning is suppressed.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

:::tip
Once a dependency with the same `groupId:artifactId` exists in the `cli` profile,
the warning on the original `latest` version is automatically suppressed.
:::

:::note
The inspection also detects other non-resolvable version patterns (e.g. placeholders
that don't contain a numeric version). It works in `configuration.dependencies`,
`configuration.extraDependencies`, and their profile-specific variants.
:::

## Dependency Change Tracking

The plugin monitors your dependency declarations for changes. When you add, remove, or modify a dependency
in `configuration.dependencies` (or `extraDependencies`), a **floating toolbar** appears at the top of the editor
with two actions:

- **Refresh** — Triggers a background reload: re-resolves JARs and re-extracts task names.
- **Dismiss** — Hides the notification until the next dependency change.

The initial load happens automatically when the project is opened. After that, the plugin only prompts
for a reload when actual dependency values change (whitespace-only edits are ignored).

:::note Maven Integration
If the IntelliJ Maven plugin is installed, the plugin uses its configured repositories and local repository path.
Otherwise, it falls back to the default `~/.m2/repository` location.
