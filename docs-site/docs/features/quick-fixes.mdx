# Quick Fixes

The Concord IntelliJ Plugin doesn't just find errors—it helps you fix them. **Quick Fixes** provide automated solutions for common typos, configuration errors, and documentation mismatches, saving you time and reducing manual effort.

## How to Use

When the IDE detects a problem that has a known solution, it will offer a Quick Fix:

1.  Place the caret on the **highlighted error or warning**.
2.  Press <Keystroke mac={[{icon: "⌥", label: "Alt"}, {label: "⏎"}]} win={[{label: "Alt"}, {label: "Enter"}]} /> to open the intention menu.
3.  Select the suggested fix from the list and press `Enter`.

## Key Quick Fixes

### 1. Document Missing Parameter
If you use a new variable in your flow but haven't added it to the <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="doc-section">in:</span> section of your [Flow Documentation](./flow-docs), the plugin can automatically add it for you with the correct type.

### 2. Correct Documentation Typos
The plugin recognizes common misspellings in documentation keywords (like `mandatry` instead of <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="doc-param-mandatory">mandatory</span>) and offers to replace them instantly.

### 3. Fix Invalid Types
If you enter an invalid type in a documentation block (e.g., `strnig` instead of <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="doc-param-type">string</span>), the plugin provides a list of valid Concord types to choose from.

### 4. Resolve Duplicates
When a duplicate flow name is detected, the plugin can help you navigate between the definitions or provide options to resolve the conflict.

## Example

### Fixing a Type Error

Instantly correct typos in your documentation without re-typing:

:::tip Try it yourself
Type an incorrect type like `strnig` in a flow documentation block, then press <Keystroke mac={[{icon: "⌥", label: "Alt"}, {label: "⏎"}]} win={[{label: "Alt"}, {label: "Enter"}]} /> to see suggestions.
