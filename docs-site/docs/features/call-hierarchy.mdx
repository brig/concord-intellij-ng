# Call Hierarchy

In complex Concord projects, flows often form deep chains of execution. Understanding these dependencies is crucial for impact analysis and debugging.

The **Call Hierarchy** view helps you visualize these relationships as a tree, answering two critical questions:
*   **Callers:** "Who calls this flow?" (Upstream analysis)
*   **Callees:** "What does this flow call?" (Downstream analysis)

## Accessing the Tool

You can invoke Call Hierarchy on any **flow name** (definition) or **call step**.

*   **Shortcut:** <Keystroke mac={[{icon: "⌃", label: "Ctrl"}, {icon: "⌥", label: "Opt"}, {label: "H"}]} win={[{label: "Ctrl"}, {label: "Alt"}, {label: "H"}]} />
*   **Menu:** `Navigate | Call Hierarchy`
*   **Context Menu:** Right-click on a symbol and select `Call Hierarchy`.

## Analysis Modes

Once the tool window opens, use the toolbar buttons to switch between views.

### Caller Hierarchy
**"Who calls me?"**

This is the default view. It places your selected flow at the root. Expanding the tree reveals every flow that contains a <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="step">call</span> to it.

*   **Impact analysis:** Before renaming or changing a flow's arguments, check this view to see all the places you need to update.
*   **Dead code discovery:** Easily identify flows that are never called.

### Callee Hierarchy
**"Who do I call?"**

This inverts the tree. It shows the selected flow at the root, and expanding it reveals every sub-flow it invokes.

*   **Logic overview:** Understand the control flow of a complex "Main" process without reading every line of YAML.

## Example

Consider this deployment pipeline:

```concord
flows:
  deployProd:
    - call: buildApp
    - call: deployToCluster

  buildApp:
    - log: "Building..."

  deployToCluster:
    - log: "Deploying..."
```

### Analyzing Callers
Running the tool on `buildApp` reveals all flows that invoke it.

### Analyzing Callees
Running the tool on `deployProd` shows the sequence of steps it orchestrates.
