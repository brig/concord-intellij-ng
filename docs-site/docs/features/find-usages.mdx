# Find Usages

Managing large Concord projects requires knowing exactly where a flow is being called before you make changes. **Find Usages** allows you to locate every reference to a flow or variable across your entire project.

The tool is **scope-aware**, meaning it understands the boundaries of your Concord projects and filters results accordingly.

## How to Use

1.  Place the caret on any **flow definition** or **flow call**.
2.  Invoke Find Usages:
    *   **Shortcut:** <Keystroke mac={[{icon: "⌥", label: "Alt"}, {label: "F7"}]} win={[{label: "Alt"}, {label: "F7"}]} />
    *   **Menu:** `Edit | Find | Find Usages`
    *   **Context Menu:** Right-click and select `Find Usages`.

## Features

*   **Group by File/Module:** Organize results to see which projects or files use the flow most.
*   **Preview Pane:** See the code context for each usage without switching files.
*   **Filter Results:** Exclude certain types of usages (e.g., skip comments or documentation).

## Variable Usages

Find Usages also works for **variable declarations**, showing every `${...}` expression that references the variable. Place the caret on any of these and invoke Find Usages:

*   A key in <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="step">set</span> step
*   A key in `configuration.arguments`
*   A parameter in a flow [Documentation Block](./flow-docs)
*   An `out` field value — scalar (`out: result`), mapping key (`out: {res: ...}`), or array item (`out: [result]`) — on <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="step">task</span>, <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="step">expr</span>, <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="step">call</span>, <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="step">script</span>, <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="step">try</span>, <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="step">block</span>, and <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="step">parallel</span> steps

## Example

Consider a project with multiple deployment flows that share a common setup step:

```concord
flows:
  deployDev:
    - call: setupEnv
    - log: "Deploying to Dev"

  deployProd:
    - call: setupEnv
    - log: "Deploying to Prod"

  setupEnv:
    - log: "Setting up environment..."
```

### Locating Flow References

Running Find Usages on the `setupEnv` definition will list both `deployDev` and `deployProd` as callers.

:::tip Try it yourself
Select `setupEnv` and press <Keystroke mac={[{icon: "⌥", label: "Alt"}, {label: "F7"}]} win={[{label: "Alt"}, {label: "F7"}]} /> to see where it is used.

For a quick list of references without opening a tool window, use **Show Usages**:
<Keystroke mac={[{icon: "⌘", label: "Cmd"}, {icon: "⌥", label: "Alt"}, {label: "F7"}]} win={[{label: "Ctrl"}, {label: "Alt"}, {label: "F7"}]} />
