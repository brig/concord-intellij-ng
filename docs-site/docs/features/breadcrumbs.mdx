# Breadcrumbs

The Concord IntelliJ Plugin integrates with the IDE's **Breadcrumbs** component to provide a horizontal navigation bar at the bottom of the editor. This helps you track your location within deeply nested Concord structures, such as complex flows or configuration blocks.

## Overview

As you move your cursor through a `.concord.yaml` file, the breadcrumbs bar updates to show the path from the file root to the current element.

*   **Hierarchy:** Displays the hierarchy of sections (e.g., `flows` > `myFlow` > `task`).
*   **Navigation:** Click on any element in the breadcrumb path to move the cursor to that element.

## How to Enable

Breadcrumbs are usually enabled by default. If you don't see them:

1.  Go to **Settings/Preferences**.
2.  Navigate to **Editor | General | Breadcrumbs**.
3.  Ensure **Show breadcrumbs** is checked.
4.  Verify that **Concord** is checked in the language list.
5.  **Placement:** You can choose to show them at the **Top** or **Bottom** of the editor.

## Features

*   **Context Awareness:** Shows relevant names (e.g., flow names, step names like `call`, `log`) rather than just generic YAML node types.
*   **Quick Parent Access:** Easily jump to the parent flow or section without scrolling.

## Example

### Visualizing the Path

The breadcrumbs bar shows you exactly where you are in the file hierarchy, even in deeply nested steps:

<figure className="docFigure docFigure--sm5">
    <img src={require('@site/static/img/breadcrumbs.png').default} alt="Editor Breadcrumbs" />
    <figcaption>
        Breadcrumbs showing the path from the root to a nested step.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

:::tip
Use breadcrumbs in combination with **Structure View** for complete control over your file navigation.
