# Syntax Highlighting

The Concord IntelliJ Plugin goes beyond standard YAML highlighting. It understands the **structure and semantics** of your Concord files, applying specific colors to different parts of the flow to improve readability.

This helps you instantly distinguish between a flow name, a step keyword, a variable expression, and a regular string.

## Semantic Coloring

The plugin identifies and highlights the following elements distinctly:

### 1. Structural Elements
Top-level sections like <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="section">flows</span>, <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="section">forms</span>, <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="section">triggers</span>, <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="section">configuration</span>, and <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="section">publicFlows</span> are highlighted as keywords, making the high-level structure of the file obvious.

### 2. Flow Definitions & Calls
*   **Definitions:** When you define a flow (e.g., <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="target-id">myFlow:</span>), it is highlighted as a flow declaration (function-like construct).
*   **Calls:** When you use the <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="step">call</span> step, the target flow name is highlighted, making it easy to spot where execution jumps to another flow.

### 3. Steps & Keywords
Built-in steps (<span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="step">log</span>, <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="step">if</span>, <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="step">switch</span>, <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="step">return</span>, <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="step">throw</span>, etc.) and task names are highlighted differently from regular YAML keys. This separates the "logic" from the "data".

### 4. Expressions
Concord expressions <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="expression">{'${...}'}</span> are highlighted as code injections. This is crucial for spotting variables embedded inside strings.

### 5. Flow Documentation
Structured flow documentation blocks are recognized and highlighted as documentation, with specific colors for <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="doc-section">in</span>/<span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="doc-section">out</span> parameters, description text.

## Customizing Colors

You can fully customize the color scheme to match your preferences or accessibility needs.

1. Press <Keystroke mac={[{ icon: "⌘", label: "Cmd" }, { label: "," }]} win={[{ label: "Ctrl" }, { label: "Alt" }, { label: "S" }]} />
      to open **Settings**
2.  Go to **Editor | Color Scheme | Concord**.
3.  Click on the element you want to change in the preview pane.

:::tip
The plugin comes with built-in defaults that adapt to both **Light** and **Dark** IDE themes.

## Example

Here is how the highlighter interprets different elements:

```concord
configuration:
  runtime: concord-v2

flows:
  # A simple flow definition
  default:
    - log: "Starting the process..."

    # 'call' keyword and flow name are distinct
    - call: deployApp
      in:
        appName: "my-app"
      out: result

    - if: ${result == "success"}
      then:
        - log: "Deployment successful!"

  ##
  # Deploys the application.
  # in:
  #   appName: string, mandatory, app name
  # out:
  #   result: string, mandatory, deployment result
  ##
  deployApp:
    - log: "Deploying ${appName}..."
```

*   `configuration`, `flows` — **Top-level Sections**
*   `default`, `deployApp` — **Flow Identifiers**
*   `log`, `call`, `if` — **Keywords / Steps**
*   `${result == "success"}` — **Expressions**
*   `## ... ##` — **Documentation**
