# Rich Inspections

Beyond basic [Validation](./validation), the Concord IntelliJ Plugin includes a set of rich inspections designed to maintain code quality and prevent common mistakes before they reach production.

## Available Inspections

### 1. Duplicated Keys
Flags when the same key is defined twice within the same YAML mapping, which is invalid.

### 2. Duplicate Flow Names
Ensures that flow names are unique within a [Scope](./scopes.md). This prevents ambiguity when calling flows across different files.

### 3. Out of Scope
Warns when a `.concord.yaml` file is opened that doesn't belong to any defined Concord project. This helps diagnose issues where navigation or completion isn't working as expected.

### 4. Documentation Drift
Detects mismatches between the actual parameters used in a flow and those described in its [Documentation Block](./flow-docs).

### 5. Type Mismatches
Checks that parameter types defined in documentation match the values being passed in <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="step">call</span> steps.

## Configuring Inspections

You can control which inspections are enabled and their severity (Error, Warning, Information):

1.  Navigate to **Settings | Editor | Inspections**.
2.  Search for **Concord**.
3.  Use the checkboxes to enable/disable specific rules.

## Example

### Detecting Duplicates

Inspections help keep your monorepo clean by flagging naming collisions:

:::tip Try it yourself
Create two flows with the same name in different files within the same project and see the IDE flag them.

<figure className="docFigure">
    <img src={require('@site/static/img/inspections.png').default} alt="Rich Inspections Example" />
    <figcaption>

</figure>

:::note Inspection Severity
By default, critical issues like duplicate names are shown as **Warnings**, but you can promote them to **Errors** if you want to be more strict.
