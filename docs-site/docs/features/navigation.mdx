# Navigation

The Concord IntelliJ Plugin makes navigating large, multi-file projects effortless. It treats flow names and calls as first-class symbols, allowing you to jump between definitions and references instantly.

## Go to Declaration

The most common way to navigate is jumping from a <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="step">call</span> step to the flow's definition.

*   **Shortcut:** <Keystroke mac={[{icon: "⌘", label: "Cmd"}, {label: "B"}]} win={[{label: "Ctrl"}, {label: "B"}]} />
*   **Mouse:** <Keystroke mac={[{icon: "⌘", label: "Cmd"}]} win={[{label: "Ctrl"}]} /> + **Click** on the flow name.

This works even if the flow is defined in a different file or module, as long as it's within the same [Scope](./scopes.md).

## Go to Symbol

Quickly find and jump to any flow, form, or trigger by name across your entire project.

*   **Shortcut:** <Keystroke mac={[{icon: "⌘", label: "Cmd"}, {icon: "⌥", label: "Opt"}, {label: "O"}]} win={[{label: "Ctrl"}, {label: "Alt"}, {label: "Shift"}, {label: "N"}]} />
*   **Search Everywhere:** Press `Double Shift` and start typing the name of a flow.

## Breadcrumbs

As you navigate through deep YAML structures, breadcrumbs at the bottom of the editor help you stay oriented, showing you exactly which flow and step you are currently editing.

## Example

### Jumping to a Flow

Instantly jump from a call site to the implementation, even across the project:

:::tip Try it yourself
Hold <Keystroke mac={[{icon: "⌘", label: "Cmd"}]} win={[{label: "Ctrl"}]} /> and hover over a flow name in a `call` step. Click the link to jump to its definition.

:::note Cross-File Support
The plugin indexes all flow names in your project, so navigation is nearly instantaneous even in codebases with hundreds of files.
