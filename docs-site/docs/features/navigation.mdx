# Navigation

The Concord IntelliJ Plugin makes navigating large, multi-file projects effortless. It treats flow names and calls as first-class symbols, allowing you to jump between definitions and references instantly.

## Go to Declaration

The most common way to navigate is jumping from a <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="step">call</span> step to the flow's definition.

*   **Shortcut:** <Keystroke mac={[{icon: "⌘", label: "Cmd"}, {label: "B"}]} win={[{label: "Ctrl"}, {label: "B"}]} />
*   **Mouse:** <Keystroke mac={[{icon: "⌘", label: "Cmd"}]} win={[{label: "Ctrl"}]} /> + **Click** on the flow name.

This works even if the flow is defined in a different file or module, as long as it's within the same [Scope](./scopes.md).

### Expression Variables

<Keystroke mac={[{icon: "⌘", label: "Cmd"}]} win={[{label: "Ctrl"}]} /> + **Click** on a variable name inside a `${...}` expression to jump to where it was declared. This works for all variable sources:

*   **Arguments** — jumps to the key in `configuration.arguments`
*   **Flow parameters** — jumps to the parameter in the flow's [Documentation Block](./flow-docs)
*   **Set variables** — jumps to the key in the <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="step">set</span> step
*   **Step out variables** — jumps to the `out` field of <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="step">task</span>, <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="step">expr</span>, <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="step">call</span>, <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="step">script</span>, <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="step">try</span>, <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="step">block</span>, and <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="step">parallel</span> steps

```concord
configuration:
  arguments:
    appName: "my-app"

flows:
  main:
    - task: concord
      out: result
    - log: "${appName}            ${result}"
    #         ^ Cmd+Click jumps    ^ Cmd+Click jumps
    #         to arguments           to out: result
```

### Expression Properties

<Keystroke mac={[{icon: "⌘", label: "Cmd"}]} win={[{label: "Ctrl"}]} /> + **Click** on a property name in a dot-access chain (e.g., `host` in `${config.db.host}`) to jump to the corresponding YAML key in the source mapping. The plugin walks the property chain from the base variable's declaration through each nested mapping to find the target key.

This works for variables declared in <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="step">set</span> steps and `configuration.arguments` -- any source where the variable's value is a YAML mapping with named keys.

```concord
flows:
  main:
    - set:
        config:
          db:
            host: "localhost"
            port: 5432
    - log: "${config.db.host}"
    #                   ^ Cmd+Click jumps to the
    #                     "host" key in the set step
```

## Go to Symbol

Quickly find and jump to any flow, form, or trigger by name across your entire project.

*   **Shortcut:** <Keystroke mac={[{icon: "⌘", label: "Cmd"}, {icon: "⌥", label: "Opt"}, {label: "O"}]} win={[{label: "Ctrl"}, {label: "Alt"}, {label: "Shift"}, {label: "N"}]} />
*   **Search Everywhere:** Press `Double Shift` and start typing the name of a flow.

## Related Symbol

Quickly navigate from any Concord file to its associated root `concord.yaml` file. This is especially useful in large projects where files are deeply nested.

*   **Shortcut:** <Keystroke mac={[{icon: "⌃", label: "Ctrl"}, {icon: "⌘", label: "Cmd"}, {icon: "↑", label: "Up"}]} win={[{label: "Ctrl"}, {label: "Alt"}, {label: "Home"}]} />
*   **Menu:** Go to **Navigate** > **Related Symbol**

If a file belongs to multiple [Scopes](./scopes.md), a popup will allow you to choose which root to navigate to.

## Breadcrumbs

As you navigate through deep YAML structures, [breadcrumbs](./breadcrumbs.mdx) at the bottom of the editor help you stay oriented, showing you exactly which flow and step you are currently editing.

## Example

### Jumping to a Flow

Instantly jump from a call site to the implementation, even across the project:

:::tip Try it yourself
Hold <Keystroke mac={[{icon: "⌘", label: "Cmd"}]} win={[{label: "Ctrl"}]} /> and hover over a flow name in a `call` step. Click the link to jump to its definition.

:::note Cross-File Support
The plugin indexes all flow names in your project, so navigation is nearly instantaneous even in codebases with hundreds of files.
