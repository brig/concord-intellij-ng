# Concord Tool Window

The Concord plugin adds a dedicated **Concord** tool window to IntelliJ IDEA,
providing a structural view of all [Concord project scopes](./scopes) detected in your workspace.

## Overview

The Concord tool window allows you to:
- View all active [Concord scopes](./scopes) (defined by `concord.yaml` files).
- [Navigate](./navigation) quickly to the root definition of any scope.
- Visualize the hierarchy of your Concord projects.

## Using the Tool Window

1.  Open the tool window by clicking on **Concord** in the tool window bar (usually on the right or bottom),
or via **View | Tool Windows | Concord**.
2.  The tree view displays a list of detected [Concord scopes](./scopes). Each node represents a root Concord file.
3.  **Double-click** on a node to open the corresponding `concord.yaml` file in the editor.
4.  Use the **Refresh** button in the toolbar to manually reload the list of scopes if changes aren't reflected immediately
(though the plugin tracks changes automatically).

## Node Representation

- **Scope Name**: The node displays the relative path of the directory containing the root Concord file,
effectively showing which folders are Concord roots.
- **Icon**: Standard folder icon indicating it represents a directory scope.

## Automatic Updates

The tool window listens for changes in your project structure (like adding or removing `concord.yaml` files)
and updates automatically.
