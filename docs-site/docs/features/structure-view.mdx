# Structure View

When working with large Concord files that contain multiple flows, forms, and triggers, it can be difficult to find what you are looking for by scrolling alone.

The **Structure View** provides a tree-based outline of your file, allowing you to instantly visualize the structure and navigate to specific definitions.

## Overview

The Structure View displays a hierarchical tree of:
*   **Flows**
*   **Forms**
*   **Triggers**
*   **Public Flows**
*   **Configuration** settings

It updates in real-time as you edit the file.

## How to Use

### Opening the Tool Window

1.  Open any `.concord.yaml` file.
2.  Open the Structure tool window:
    *   **Menu:** `View | Tool Windows | Structure`
    *   **Shortcut:** <Keystroke mac={[{icon: "⌘", label: "Cmd"}, {label: "7"}]} win={[{label: "Alt"}, {label: "7"}]} />

### Using the Popup

For even faster navigation, you can use the Structure popup without leaving the editor:

*   Press <Keystroke mac={[{icon: "⌘", label: "Cmd"}, {label: "F12"}]} win={[{label: "Ctrl"}, {label: "F12"}]} />.
*   Type part of a flow name to filter the list.
*   Press `Enter` to jump to the selected element.

## Features

*   **Filter & Sort:** You can sort elements alphabetically or by occurrence.
*   **Autoscroll:** Enabling "Autoscroll from Source" will automatically highlight the current flow in the tree as you move your cursor in the editor.
*   **Icons:** Distinct icons for flows, forms, and triggers help you recognize element types at a glance.

## Example

Given the following file:

```concord
flows:
  main:
    - log: "Starting..."

  deploy:
    - call: setupEnvironment

triggers:
  - github:
      entryPoint: main

forms:
  userLogin:
    - name: username
```

### Navigating the File Structure

The Structure View provides a clear, hierarchical overview of all elements in your file:

This feature is especially useful for **monorepo** setups where a single file might define dozens of flows for different lifecycle stages (build, test, deploy).
