# Rename Refactoring

Renaming a flow in a large project can be risky if done manually. You might miss a reference in another file, leading to runtime errors.

The **Rename Refactoring** feature allows you to change a flow's name safely. The plugin automatically finds every <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="step">call</span> to that flow within the current [Scope](./scopes.md) and updates them for you.

## How to Use

1.  Place the caret on the **flow name** (at its definition or at any call site).
2.  Invoke Rename:
    *   **Shortcut:** <Keystroke mac={[{icon: "⇧", label: "Shift"}, {label: "F6"}]} win={[{label: "Shift"}, {label: "F6"}]} />
    *   **Menu:** `Refactor | Rename`
3.  Type the new name and press `Enter`.

## Features

*   **Preview Changes:** Before applying the rename, you can see a list of all files and lines that will be updated.
*   **Search in Comments:** Optionally find and update the name inside comments and strings.
*   **Scope Protection:** Rename only affects files within the relevant Concord scope, ensuring you don't accidentally change unrelated projects in a monorepo.

## Example

### Safe Refactoring

Watch as the plugin updates multiple files simultaneously to keep your project consistent:

:::tip Try it yourself
Select a flow name, press <Keystroke mac={[{icon: "⇧", label: "Shift"}, {label: "F6"}]} win={[{label: "Shift"}, {label: "F6"}]} />, type a new name, and observe how all call sites are updated instantly.

:::warning Check Results
Always review the "Find Refactor Usages" tool window if it appears, to ensure that the rename is being applied exactly where you expect.
