# Schema Validation

The Concord IntelliJ Plugin provides deep, semantic validation of your project. It doesn't just check for valid YAML syntax; it understands the rules of the Concord DSL and flags logical errors in real-time.

## Key Inspections

### Unknown or Invalid Keys
If you misspell a keyword or place it in the wrong context, the IDE will highlight it immediately.

```concord
flows:
  main:
    stepps: # Error: Unexpected key 'stepps'
      - log: "Hello"
```

### Missing Required Keys
Some steps require specific keys to be functional. For example, an <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="step">if</span> step must have a <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="step">then</span> block.

```concord
flows:
  main:
    - if: "${deployFailed}" # Error: Missing required key 'then'
```

### Duplicate Flow Definitions
Namespaces (Scopes) must have unique flow names. The plugin detects when you accidentally define the same flow multiple times across different files.

```concord
# In project-a/concord.yaml
flows:
  myFlow: # Warning: Duplicate flow definition
    - log: "A"

# In project-a/flows/utils.yaml
flows:
  myFlow: # Warning: Duplicate flow definition
    - log: "B"
```

### Documentation Block Validation
The plugin also validates the content of your [Flow Documentation](./flow-docs), checking for valid types and keywords.

```concord
flows:
  ##
  # in:
  #    userName: strnig
  ##
  main:
    - log: "Hello, ${userName}"
```

## How to Configure

Validation is implemented as standard IntelliJ inspections. You can customize their severity or disable them entirely:

1.  Open **Settings | Editor | Inspections**.
2.  Navigate to the **Concord** section.
3.  Adjust the severity of individual checks (Error, Warning, Weak Warning, etc.).

## Example

### Catching Errors Early

Real-time validation helps you fix issues before you even try to run the flow:

:::tip Try it yourself
Intentionally misspell a keyword like `log` as `logg` and see the IDE highlight it with an error description.
:::

<figure className="docFigure">
    <img src={require('@site/static/img/validation.png').default} alt="Validation Example" />
    <figcaption>
        Real-time validation highlighting a missing required key in an <code>if</code> step.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

:::note Integrated Quick Fixes
Many validation errors come with suggested [Quick Fixes](./quick-fixes). Press <Keystroke mac={[{icon: "⌥", label: "Alt"}, {label: "⏎"}]} win={[{label: "Alt"}, {label: "Enter"}]} /> to see available solutions.
