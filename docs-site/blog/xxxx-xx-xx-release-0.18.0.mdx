The `0.18.0` release introduces the **[Concord Tool Window](/docs/features/tool-window)** for a bird's-eye view of your project,
**[Dependency Management](/docs/features/dependencies)** with task name completion and error reporting,
and **[Related Symbol](/docs/features/navigation#related-symbol)** navigation to quickly jump to root files.

## Concord Tool Window

A new dedicated tool window gives you an at-a-glance overview of your Concord project structure.
The tree displays your scopes, root files, dependencies, and resources in a single panel.

*   **Navigate Instantly:** Double-click any item to jump directly to its source.
*   **Always Up-to-Date:** The tree automatically refreshes when project files change.
*   **Scope Awareness:** Each scope is displayed as a top-level node, making it easy to work with monorepos.

## Dependency Management

### Task Name Completion

The plugin now scans Maven dependencies declared in your `concord.yaml` and extracts `@Named` task names from JARs.
This means you get scope-aware autocompletion for <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="step">task</span> step values—no more guessing task names or hunting through documentation.

### Dependency Error Reporting

Unresolved dependencies are now surfaced directly in the editor as inline inspections,
so you can spot configuration problems without leaving your flow file.
Errors are also reported in the **Build Sync** tab with clickable navigation,
and problem files are marked red in the Project tree.

## Related Symbol Navigation

You can now navigate from any Concord file to its associated root `concord.yaml` file.
This is especially useful in large projects where resource files are deeply nested.

*   **Shortcut:** <Keystroke mac={[{icon: "⌃", label: "Ctrl"}, {icon: "⌘", label: "Cmd"}, {icon: "↑", label: "Up"}]} win={[{label: "Ctrl"}, {label: "Alt"}, {label: "Home"}]} />
*   **Menu:** Go to **Navigate** > **Related Symbol**

If a file belongs to multiple scopes, a popup will let you choose which root to navigate to.

## Other Improvements

*   **Scope-Strict Flow Completion:** Flow completion now strictly respects the search scope, preventing suggestions from leaking across project boundaries.
