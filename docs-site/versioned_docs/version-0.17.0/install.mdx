# Install / Download

Get Concord YAML language support in IntelliJ IDEA: validation, navigation, completion, call hierarchy, find usages, and refactoring.

## Install from JetBrains Marketplace

1. Press <Keystroke mac={[{ icon: "⌘", label: "Cmd" }, { label: "," }]} win={[{ label: "Ctrl" }, { label: "Alt" }, { label: "S" }]} />
to open settings and then select **Plugins**.
2. Click the **Marketplace** tab and type **Concord** in the search field.
3. Click **Install**
4. Restart the IDE if asked

:::tip
If you have multiple JetBrains IDEs installed (IDEA / WebStorm / PyCharm), make sure you’re installing into the right one.
:::

## Install from disk (ZIP)

Use this if you downloaded a plugin build from GitHub Releases or CI artifacts.

1. Download the plugin ZIP file from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/brig/concord-intellij-ng/releases)
2. Press <Keystroke mac={[{ icon: "⌘", label: "Cmd" }, { label: "," }]} win={[{ label: "Ctrl" }, { label: "Alt" }, { label: "S" }]} />
to open settings and then select **Plugins**.
3. Click the gear icon ⚙️ → **Install Plugin from Disk…**
4. Select the plugin archive file and click **OK**.
5. Click **OK** to apply the changes and restart the IDE if prompted.

:::note
ZIP install is useful for preview builds or testing fixes before a Marketplace release.

## Requirements

- IntelliJ platform **2025.3+**
- Concord YAML files (typically `*.concord.yaml`)

## Verify it works

Try these actions in a Concord YAML file:

- **Go to Declaration** <Keystroke mac={[{ icon: "⌘", label: "Cmd" }, { label: "B" }]} win={[{ label: "Ctrl" }, { label: "B" }]}/>
on a flow reference (`call:`)
- **Call Hierarchy** <Keystroke mac={[{ icon: "⌘", label: "Cmd" }, { icon: "⌥", label: "Alt" }, { label: "H" }]} win={[{ label: "Ctrl" }, { label: "Alt" },{ label: "H" }]}/> on a flow name
- **Find Usages** <Keystroke mac={[{ icon: "⌥", label: "Alt" }, { label: "F7" }]} win={[{ label: "Alt" }, { label: "F7" }]}/>
on a flow name

:::tip
If nothing happens, confirm the file is recognized as Concord YAML (file name pattern like `*.concord.yaml`) and restart the IDE once.

## Troubleshooting

### The plugin is installed but nothing happens

- Restart the IDE after installation
- Confirm your IDE version is supported by the plugin release you installed
- Make sure you’re editing Concord YAML (`*.concord.yaml`)

### Marketplace version vs GitHub version

- **Marketplace**: stable releases
- **GitHub Releases / CI**: preview builds and testing artifacts
