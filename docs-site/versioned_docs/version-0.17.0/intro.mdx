# Introduction

Writing complex workflows in plain YAML is hard. You lose context, make typos, and spend hours debugging issues that a compiler would catch instantly.

**Concord IntelliJ Plugin** treats Concord YAML as a **first-class language**. It brings the full power of IntelliJ IDEA — navigation, refactoring, and static analysis — to your Concord flows.

## From Text to Code

The plugin transforms your editing experience from "guessing strings" to "writing code":

*   **Don't guess flow names.** Auto-complete them with context-aware suggestions.
*   **Don't search for definitions.** <Keystroke mac={[{icon: "⌘", label: "Cmd"}, {label: "B"}]} win={[{label: "Ctrl"}, {label: "B"}]} /> jumps straight to the flow, even across files.
*   **Don't break callers.** Rename flows safely with <Keystroke mac={[{icon: "⇧", label: "Shift"}, {label: "F6"}]} win={[{label: "Shift"}, {label: "F6"}]} />.
*   **Don't push typos.** Catch schema errors right in the editor before they hit CI.

## Key Capabilities

> *Detailed features are described in the [Features Overview](./features/overview.mdx).*

<div className="capGrid">

    <CapabilityCard
        icon={NavigationIcon}
        title="Smart Navigation"
        to="/docs/features/navigation"
        tryHint={
            <Keystroke
                mac={[{ icon: "⌘", label: "Cmd" }, { label: "B" }]}
                win={[{ label: "Ctrl" }, { label: "B" }]}
            />
        }
    >
        Jump through flows like code — not files.
    </CapabilityCard>

    <CapabilityCard
        icon={AnalysisIcon}
        title="Deep Analysis"
        to="/docs/features/call-hierarchy"

                  win={[{ label: "Ctrl" }, { label: "Alt" }, { label: "H" }]}
            />
        }
    >
        See caller–callee dependencies instantly.
    </CapabilityCard>

    <CapabilityCard
        icon={SafetyIcon}
        title="Safety Net"
        to="/docs/features/validation"
        tryHint="Validation"
    >
        Catch schema and type errors as you type.
    </CapabilityCard>

## Philosophy

Concord flows are **code**. They have variables, functions (flows), imports, and dependencies. They deserve the same tooling quality as Java, Kotlin, or TypeScript.

Our goal is to cover the entire development lifecycle:
1.  **Authoring:** Writing flows with total IDE assistance.
2.  **Maintenance:** Refactoring and navigating large-scale projects.
3.  **Execution:** Running and testing flows locally using integrated tools.

:::tip Quick Start
Open any `.concord.yaml` file, hold `Cmd` (on Mac) or `Ctrl` (on Windows), and hover over a flow name in a `call` step. If it turns into a link, you're ready to go!
