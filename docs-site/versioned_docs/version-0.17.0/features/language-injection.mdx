# Language Injection

The Concord IntelliJ Plugin provides automatic language injection for <span className="tokenBadge" data-kind="step">script</span> steps. This means when you are writing a script in a supported language within your Concord YAML, the IDE treats it as code in that language, providing full editing support.

## Supported Languages

The following languages are currently supported for injection:

*   **Groovy** (`groovy`)
*   **JavaScript** (`js`, `javascript`)
*   **Python** (`python`)
*   **Ruby** (`ruby`)

## How it Works

The plugin automatically detects the language based on the `script` property of the step. When you define a `body` for the script, the corresponding language is injected into the scalar value.

### Example

```concord
flows:
  default:
    - script: groovy
      body: |
        // This is highlighted and edited as Groovy code
        def name = "Concord"
        println "Hello, ${name}!"
```

## Implicit Variables & Autocompletion

Concord automatically exposes specific variables to scripts during execution. The plugin is aware of these implicit variables and provides **code completion** for them directly within the injected script block.

This ensures you can easily discover and use available context objects without leaving the IDE editor.

## Features within Injected Code

Once a language is injected, you gain access to standard IDE features for that language inside the YAML block:

*   **Syntax Highlighting:** Proper coloring for keywords, strings, and variables.
*   **Code Completion:** Suggestions for standard library functions, variables, and Concord implicit objects.
*   **Inspections & Quick Fixes:** Error detection and automated fixes specific to the language.
*   **Formatting:** Reformat injected code according to language-specific style guides.

## Example
