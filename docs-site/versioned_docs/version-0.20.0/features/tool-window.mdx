# Concord Tool Window

The Concord plugin adds a dedicated **Concord** tool window to IntelliJ IDEA,
providing a structural view of all [Concord project scopes](./scopes) detected in your workspace.

## Overview

The Concord tool window allows you to:
- View all active [Concord scopes](./scopes) (defined by `concord.yaml` files).
- See the **root file**, **dependencies**, and **resource files** for each scope.
- [Navigate](./navigation) quickly to any file or dependency declaration.
- Visualize the hierarchy of your Concord projects.

## Using the Tool Window

1.  Open the tool window by clicking on **Concord** in the tool window bar (usually on the right or bottom),
or via **View | Tool Windows | Concord**.
2.  The tree view displays a list of detected [Concord scopes](./scopes).
3.  Expand a scope node to see its root file, dependencies, and resource files.
4.  **Double-click** on any node to navigate to the corresponding file or dependency declaration.
5.  Use the **Refresh** button in the toolbar to manually reload the tree
(though the plugin tracks changes automatically).

## Tree Structure

Each scope in the tree has the following child nodes:

### Root File

The `concord.yaml` (or `.concord.yml`, etc.) file that defines the scope. Double-click to open it in the editor.

### Dependencies

Lists all Maven dependencies declared in the scope's `configuration.dependencies` and `configuration.extraDependencies`
sections (including those inside `profiles`).

Each dependency is displayed as a `groupId:artifactId:version` string. Double-click a dependency to navigate to its
declaration in the YAML file. If the same dependency is declared in multiple files within the scope,
a popup lets you choose which occurrence to navigate to.

:::tip
Dependencies are used by the plugin to provide [task name completion](./dependencies#task-name-completion).
:::

### Resources

Lists all YAML resource files that belong to the scope (files in the `concord/` directory or matched by
the `resources` directive). Double-click any file to open it in the editor.

File paths are shown relative to the scope root directory.

## Automatic Updates

The tool window listens for changes in your project structure (like adding or removing `concord.yaml` files
or modifying dependency declarations) and updates automatically.
