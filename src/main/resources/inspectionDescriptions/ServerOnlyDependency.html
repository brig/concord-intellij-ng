<p>
    Reports dependencies with versions that can only be resolved by the Concord server
    (e.g. <code>latest</code> or placeholder values like <code>PROJECT_VERSION</code>).
</p>

<p>
    These versions are valid at runtime but cannot be resolved locally by the IDE.
    A quick fix is available to add a concrete version to the <code>idea</code> profile
    for IDE support while keeping the original version for server resolution.
