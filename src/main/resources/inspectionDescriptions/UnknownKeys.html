    Reports unknown keys in Concord YAML files.
</p>

<p>
    Concord YAML supports a well-defined set of keys at each level of a flow definition.
    Unknown or misspelled keys are invalid and cause a validation error in Concord.
    This inspection highlights keys that are not recognized in the current context so you can fix typos
    or remove unsupported entries.
</p>

<pre><code>configuration:
  runtime: concord-v2
  timeout: 10  # ← unknown key (maybe `processTimeout`?)
</code></pre>

<p>
    This inspection is applied only to Concord YAML files.
